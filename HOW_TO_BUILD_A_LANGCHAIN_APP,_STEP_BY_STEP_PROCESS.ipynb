        "\n",
        "1. **Get an OpenAI API key.** Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and click on the **+ Create new secret key** button. Enter an identifier name (optional) and click on the **Create secret key** button. Copy the API key to be used in this tutorial.\n",
        "2. **Set up the coding environment.** You can use any programming language that LangChain supports, such as Python, JavaScript, or Go. In this tutorial, we will use Python.\n",
        "3. **Import the necessary libraries.** You will need to import the following libraries:\n",
        "    * `streamlit`\n",
        "    * `langchain`\n",
        "    * `openai`\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Create a new LangChain app.** You can do this by creating a new Python file and importing the `langchain` library. Then, you can create a new `LLMChain` object by passing in your OpenAI API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Define your prompts.** Prompts are the instructions that you give to your language model. They can be anything from simple questions to complex tasks. In this tutorial, we will define a simple prompt that asks the language model to generate a poem.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Run your app.** Once you have defined your prompts, you can run your app by running the `streamlit run` command in the terminal.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Deploy your app.** Once you are happy with your app, you can deploy it to a web server. You can do this by using a service like Heroku or AWS.\n",
        "\n",
